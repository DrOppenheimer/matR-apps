# This script uses matR to generate 2 or 3 dimmensional pcoas

# basic operation is to produce a color-less pcoa of the input data

# user can also input a table to specify colors
# This table can contain colors (as hex or nominal) or can contain metadata
# that is automatically interpreted to produce coloring (identical values or text receive the same color
# 
# The user can also input a pch table -- this is more advanced R plotting that allows them to 
# select the shape of the plotted points
#
# example invocations are below - going from simplest to most elaborate

# create a 3d plot, minimum input arguments

plot_mg_pcoa(table_in="test_data.txt")

# create a 2d plot, minimum input arguments

# create a 3d plot without data labels

# create a 3d plot with colors specified by a color_table file 
# (by default, first column of color table is used) and the script expecpts
# entries to be literal or hex colors:

plot_mg_pcoa(table_in="test_data.txt", color_table="test_colors.txt")

# create a 3d
