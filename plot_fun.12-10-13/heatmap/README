# This is a function that uses matR to generate heatmap-dendrogram vizualizations
# It's a stripped down simple version for basic viz
# pretty much the only user option is to decide if they want the rows labeled

# here's a minimal invocation

plot_mg_heatdend(table_in="test_data.txt")

# here's an invocation that explicitly addresses all of the input args

plot_mg_heatdend(table_in="test_data.txt", image_out="my_heat-dend",label_rows=TRUE, image_width_in=10, image_height_in=10, image_res_dpi=200)

# NOTE: These examples take a few minutes to run.
